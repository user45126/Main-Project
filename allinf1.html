            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2">Stunning scenery:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore2">All around England you are confronted with spectacular scenery, from luscious forests to rolling hills. Yes, there are plenty of towns and cities that you perhaps wouldn’t class as ‘beautiful’, but they are all surrounded by picturesque countryside that beckons to be explored. If you get outdoors and enjoy the parks, woodlands, moors and hills of England, then you’re never far away from stunning scenery.</p>
            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2" id="dolore3">Sprawling countryside:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">The English countryside may be heavily parodied across popular culture, but the visions of quaint villages, pretty rivers and green fields are true in certain parts of the country. If you visit the Forest of Bowland, the South Downs or any other areas of outstanding natural beauty, you will understand why England was voted one of the top 10 most beautiful countries in the world.</p>
            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2"> Majestic lakes:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">Beautiful lakes are scattered all across England, but nowhere are there as many incredible bodies of water as in the Lake District. There are 16 lakes, meres and tarns in the dramatic National Park including Windermere, the largest lake in England. All of the lakes are beautiful in their own way, but Coniston Water and Ullswater are two of the most visually appealing.</p>
            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2">Beautiful waterfalls:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">There are many noteworthy waterfalls all around England, most of which are located within the National Parks. The Yorkshire Dales in particular is home to many iconic cascades, including Hardraw Force (the tallest single-drop waterfall in England) and Ingleton Falls (a circular trail that takes in a staggering series of waterfalls including the stunning Thornton Force).</p>
            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2">Traditional towns & villages:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">England’s towns and cities are a mixed bunch, but among the grey concrete and industrial eyesores you will find a vast variety of beautifully quaint villages and traditional market towns. From stunning cities such as York and Bath to delightful seaside towns such as Whitby and Clovelly, and cute little countryside villages like Castle Combe and Rye; there are a never-ending array of beautiful places to discover.</p>

            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore2">In travellers’ terms, Turkey is in a league of its own. This is the place where East meets West; where Europe and Asia collide and produce a transcontinental culture clash. Amazing food, diverse traditions, religions and histories – these are the things that make Turkey such an unforgettable travel destination.</p>

            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">Although Turkey is known for its beautiful beaches and hot air balloon-filled skies, it’s so much more than that. Once the playground of great figures such as Cleopatra, Caesar and Alexander the Great, Turkey’s historical significance is proudly displayed in the palaces, mosques, monasteries and countless archaeological sites that dot the vast landscape. There are no fewer than 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Turkey plus 41 national parks where unforgettable valleys, lakes and mountains lay in wait.</p>
            
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">Fragrant bazaars and stunning views at every corner, from the narrow streets of Istanbul – one of the world’s great cities – to Turkey’s small towns and villages, the urban landscape is every bit as enigmatic.</p>

            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore2">Few countries receive as many accolades for their beauty as Italy, which has taken the top spot in this year's poll of the most beautiful countries in the world. From the rolling vineyards of Tuscany to the sparkling Amalfi coast and the dolomite mountains of Trentino, this relatively small place has a host of different landscapes. Roman ruins scatter the country, meaning you'll feel connected to Italy's storied heritage everywhere you turn. Cities like Rome, Florence and Venice - some of the most beautiful cities in the world - throb with romance, while rooftop villages will connect you with long-held traditions.</p>
            <h1 class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore2">TOURISM:</h1>
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">Of course, there's also the incredible Italian food, from bright, fresh vegetables on market stalls to the green-gold of cold-pressed olive oil. Several of you noted that Italy has the world's highest number of Unesco Heritage Sites. Others commented on the "lovely towns and cities as well as scenic rural areas" plus some "beautiful beaches". Put everything together and you've got one very special country.</p>
           
            <p class="animated slideInLeft" style="animation-delay: 0.1s" id="dolore1" id="dolore4">See here our round up of the most beautiful places in Italy, get to know the country more intimately with some astonishing facts about Italy.</p>

The country ranks at the top for environmental quality, according to the OECD’s Better Life Index.</p>
